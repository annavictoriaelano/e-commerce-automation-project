## 📊 Test Execution

Tests are automatically executed on every push to the main branch via GitHub Actions, ensuring continuous validation across multiple browsers.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Page Object Model:** Clean separation of test logic and page interactions
- **Cross-Browser Testing:** Validates functionality across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit
- **Reusable Components:** BasePage class with common methods inherited by all page objects
- **Professional Git Workflow:** Feature branches, pull requests, and automated CI/CD
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** 104 automated test cases covering critical user journeys
- **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript implementation for better code quality

## 📝 Test Case Organization

Test cases follow a hierarchical naming convention:
- **Module ID:** M01, M02, etc.
- **Test Scenario ID:** TS01, TS02, etc.
- **Test Case ID:** TC01, TC02, etc.

Example: `M01_TS01_TC01` represents Module 01, Test Scenario 01, Test Case 01

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

The project uses GitHub Actions to:
- Run all tests on every push to main branch
- Execute tests across multiple browsers in parallel
- Generate and store test reports as artifacts
- Ensure code quality before merging feature branches
